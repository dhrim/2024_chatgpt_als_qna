Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis x Clinical trials x Mesenchymal stromal cells x Intrathecal ABSTRACT Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this open-label phase I clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in ALS patients. Eight patients with definite or probable ALS were enrolled. After a 3-month lead-in period, autologous MSCs were isolated two times from the BM at an interval of 26 days and were then expanded in vitro for 28 days and suspended in autologous cerebrospinal fluid. Of the 8 patients, 7 received 2 intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs (1 3 106 cells per kg) 26 days apart. Clinical or lab- oratory measurements were recorded to evaluate the safety 12 months after the first MSC injection. The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the Appel ALS score, and forced vital capacity were used to evaluate the patients’ disease status. One patient died before treatment and was withdrawn from the study. With the exception of that patient, no serious adverse events were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. Most of the adverse events were self-limited or subsided after supportive treatment within 4 days. Decline in the ALSFRS-R score was not accelerated during the 6-month follow-up period. Two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs were safe and feasible throughout the duration of the 12-month follow-up period. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 SIGNIFICANCE Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To the authors’ best knowledge, there are no clinical trials to evaluate the safety of repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in ALS. After the clinical trial (phase I/II) was conducted, the stem cell (HYNR-CS, NEURONATA-R) was included in the revision of the regulations on orphan drug designation (number 160 December 31, 2013) and approved as a New Drug Application (Department of Cell and Gene Therapy 233 July 30, 2014) by the Korean Food and Drug Administration. The phase II trial is expected to be reported later. INTRODUCTION Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurode- generative disorder involving the motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. The disease is characterized by weakness, which culminates in death within 3–5 years [1, 2]. There is no effective therapeutic regimen for ALS. Recent clinical trials using var- ious type of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [3], neural stem cells [4], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [5, 6], represent promising strategies for stem cell- based treatment in ALS. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the positive effects of MSCs, including their potent anti-inflammatory capacity, direct release of antiapoptotic and neurotrophic factors, and ability to induce the proliferation of local neural progenitor cells [7, 8]. Additionally, it has been reported that MSCs have the potential benefit of modulating the functions of immune cells involved in both adap- tive and innate immunity [9–12]. Altogether, this wide range of effects of MSCs might be beneficial for the treatment of ALS. In our previous study using superoxide dis- mutase 1 (SOD1) mutant mice, we evaluated the dose-dependent effects of human bone mar- row (BM)-derived MSCs. Administration of MSCs (1 3 106 cells) into the cisterna magna signifi- cantly prolonged the life span and slowed the disease progression [13]. These results suggest STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 Oh, Moon, Kim et al. 591 that intrathecal injection of an optimized number of MSCs might demonstrate a therapeutic potential for ALS. Recently, animal studies have shown that repeated intrathecal administrations of MSC were better than single administration [14, 15]. Previous clinical trials in ALS have showed that single intrathe- cal administration of MSCs is safe and feasible [16, 17]. The pilot clinical study (Hanyang University Hospital [HYUH] Institutional Review Board [IRB] 2005-452 and 2006-339) was performed we investigated whether two intrathecal injections of an opti- mized number of MSCs into ALS patients would be safe and fea- sible during a 6-month follow-up period. The results of the pilot study suggested that repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs might be useful for altering the disease progression in ALS patients [18, 19]. In the present study, we performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of two repeated intrathecal injec- tions of autologous BM-derived MSCs in patients with ALS during a 12-month follow-up period. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Overview This study was an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs, con- ducted in Hanyang University Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The study was approved by the IRB of Hanyang University Hospital (HYUH IRB 2010-C-70) and by the Korean Food and Drug Admin- istration (KFDA-2413). This study was registered at http://www. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01363401). This study was divided into a 3-month lead-in period, a 4-month initial follow-up period and an 8-month secondary follow-up period (Fig. 1 supplemental online Table 1). During the 3-month lead-in period (visits 1–5 [V1–V5], 23 to 0 months), the patients visited the clinic every month to evaluate the natural progression of the disease. After the first MSC injection (V5, 0 months), all patients were assessed at monthly intervals during the 4-month initial follow-up period (V5–V9, 0 to +4 months). Af- ter that period, we extended the study (HYUH IRB 2013-06-019 and 2013-08-022) to further evaluate the safety for up to 12 months after the first MSC injection. The essential procedures of this clinical trial were composed of two bone marrow extractions (BME) and two intrathecal injec- tions. To allow sufficient time for MSC expansion ex vivo, each BME was performed 28 days prior to each MSC injection. The BM was extracted at V3 and V4. The MSCs were injected 28 days after each BME, at V5 and V6. The overall trial-related activities and documents were mon- itored by an independent auditing board (Dream Clinical Investi- gation Services, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea, http://www. dreamcis.com). An external trial monitor was enlisted to protect the rights and wellbeing of the participants, to verify the accuracy of the trial data, and to guarantee that the conduct of the trial was in compliance with the approved protocol according to good clin- ical practice guidelines. Selection Criteria Patients between 25 and 75 years of age who were diagnosed with clinically probable or definite ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria, were eligible for this study [20]. The other in- clusion criteria included an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Func- tional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) score between 31 and 46, riluzole treatment at the stable dose (50 mg, twice daily) at least 3 months prior to screening, and a disease duration no longer than 5 years prior to the first diagnosis. Patients who had participated in other clinical trials were excluded. The other exclusion criteria were a forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 40% of the predicted value, the presence of any con- comitant disease that might interfere with the outcome (neuro- logical disease other than ALS, psychiatric disorders, cancer, systemic disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal disor- der, or any other disease), tracheostomal ventilation or nonin- vasive ventilation (NIV) for more than 12 hours per day, a hemorrhagic tendency at the time of screening, and the admin- istration of any drug that could affect the BM. All patients pro- vided their written informed consent prior to the screening. Bone Marrow Extraction Each patient was admitted prior to the BME procedure. Under lo- cal anesthesia, BME was performed at the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or right lateral decubitus position. Approximately 50 ml of BM inocula was collected from each patient. On the day following BM extraction, the puncture site was examined, and the patient was then discharged if there were no adverse events (AEs). MSC Preparation and Culture The MSCs were isolated, expanded, and analyzed under good manufacturing practice conditions at Corestem, Inc. (Seoul, Re- public of Korea, http://corestem.com). BM mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Premium GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, http://www.gehealthcare. com) density gradient centrifugation. The mononuclear cells (2 3 105 cells) were placed in a 175-cm2 flask (Thermo Scientific Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark, http://www.nuncbrand.com) and cultured in CSBM-A06 medium (Corestem, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, http://www.lifetech.com), 2.5 mM L-alanyl-L -glutamine (Bio- chrom AG, Berlin, Germany, http://www.biochrom.de), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Biochrom AG) in a humidified incu- bator at 37°C under 5% CO2 conditions. The nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the medium. After removing the nonadherent cells, the culture medium was changed twice a week. When the MSC primary cultures reached 80% conflu- ence, the cells were harvested using 0.125% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and subcultured. Every harvest of MSCs resulted in a homogenous population of cells that displayed high expres- sion levels of CD29, CD44, CD73, and CD105 and low expression levels of CD34 and CD45 (Table 1). To confirm sterility, the sam- ples were cultured for bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mycoplasma, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was also performed to detect contaminating mycoplasma. No evidence of bacterial, fungal, viral, or mycoplasmal contamination was found (supplemental online Table 2). The MSCs were supplied as a sus- pension (concentration, 1 3 107 cells per ml) in autologous ce- rebrospinal fluid (CSF) and delivered to the hospital for administration to the patient in a container that was main- tained at 2–8°C for 30 minutes or less. Treatment Procedure The patients in the study received two successive intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs at 26-day intervals, at V5 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 592 Repeated Intrathecal Autologous BM-Derived MSCs Figure 1. Study design of the trial. This study consists of a 3-month lead-in period, a 4-month initial follow-up period, and an 8-month secondary follow-up period. The first MSC injection was performed at V5 (+0 months). The BM extraction at V3 (21 months) was for the first injection at V5. The BM extraction at V4 (2 days prior to V5) was for cells for the first injection at V6. Abbreviations: BME, bone marrow extraction MSC, mes- enchymal stromal cell Mo, months V, visit. Table 1.\n"

The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the Appel ALS score, and forced vital capacity were used to evaluate the patients’ disease status. One patient died before treatment and was withdrawn from the study. With the exception of that patient, no serious adverse events were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. Most of the adverse events were self-limited or subsided after supportive treatment within 4 days. Decline in the ALSFRS-R score was not accelerated during the 6-month follow-up period. Two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs were safe and feasible throughout the duration of the 12-month follow-up period. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 SIGNIFICANCE Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To the authors’ best knowledge, there are no clinical trials to evaluate the safety of repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in ALS. After the clinical trial (phase I/II) was conducted, the stem cell (HYNR-CS, NEURONATA-R) was included in the revision of the regulations on orphan drug designation (number 160 December 31, 2013) and approved as a New Drug Application (Department of Cell and Gene Therapy 233 July 30, 2014) by the Korean Food and Drug Administration. The phase II trial is expected to be reported later. INTRODUCTION Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurode- generative disorder involving the motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. The disease is characterized by weakness, which culminates in death within 3–5 years [1, 2]. There is no effective therapeutic regimen for ALS. Recent clinical trials using var- ious type of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [3], neural stem cells [4], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [5, 6], represent promising strategies for stem cell- based treatment in ALS. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the positive effects of MSCs, including their potent anti-inflammatory capacity, direct release of antiapoptotic and neurotrophic factors, and ability to induce the proliferation of local neural progenitor cells [7, 8]. Additionally, it has been reported that MSCs have the potential benefit of modulating the functions of immune cells involved in both adap- tive and innate immunity [9–12]. Altogether, this wide range of effects of MSCs might be beneficial for the treatment of ALS. In our previous study using superoxide dis- mutase 1 (SOD1) mutant mice, we evaluated the dose-dependent effects of human bone mar- row (BM)-derived MSCs. Administration of MSCs (1 3 106 cells) into the cisterna magna signifi- cantly prolonged the life span and slowed the disease progression [13]. These results suggest STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 Oh, Moon, Kim et al. 591 that intrathecal injection of an optimized number of MSCs might demonstrate a therapeutic potential for ALS. Recently, animal studies have shown that repeated intrathecal administrations of MSC were better than single administration [14, 15]. Previous clinical trials in ALS have showed that single intrathe- cal administration of MSCs is safe and feasible [16, 17]. The pilot clinical study (Hanyang University Hospital [HYUH] Institutional Review Board [IRB] 2005-452 and 2006-339) was performed we investigated whether two intrathecal injections of an opti- mized number of MSCs into ALS patients would be safe and fea- sible during a 6-month follow-up period. The results of the pilot study suggested that repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs might be useful for altering the disease progression in ALS patients [18, 19]. In the present study, we performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of two repeated intrathecal injec- tions of autologous BM-derived MSCs in patients with ALS during a 12-month follow-up period. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Overview This study was an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs, con- ducted in Hanyang University Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The study was approved by the IRB of Hanyang University Hospital (HYUH IRB 2010-C-70) and by the Korean Food and Drug Admin- istration (KFDA-2413). This study was registered at http://www. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01363401). This study was divided into a 3-month lead-in period, a 4-month initial follow-up period and an 8-month secondary follow-up period (Fig. 1 supplemental online Table 1). During the 3-month lead-in period (visits 1–5 [V1–V5], 23 to 0 months), the patients visited the clinic every month to evaluate the natural progression of the disease. After the first MSC injection (V5, 0 months), all patients were assessed at monthly intervals during the 4-month initial follow-up period (V5–V9, 0 to +4 months). Af- ter that period, we extended the study (HYUH IRB 2013-06-019 and 2013-08-022) to further evaluate the safety for up to 12 months after the first MSC injection. The essential procedures of this clinical trial were composed of two bone marrow extractions (BME) and two intrathecal injec- tions. To allow sufficient time for MSC expansion ex vivo, each BME was performed 28 days prior to each MSC injection. The BM was extracted at V3 and V4. The MSCs were injected 28 days after each BME, at V5 and V6. The overall trial-related activities and documents were mon- itored by an independent auditing board (Dream Clinical Investi- gation Services, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea, http://www. dreamcis.com). An external trial monitor was enlisted to protect the rights and wellbeing of the participants, to verify the accuracy of the trial data, and to guarantee that the conduct of the trial was in compliance with the approved protocol according to good clin- ical practice guidelines. Selection Criteria Patients between 25 and 75 years of age who were diagnosed with clinically probable or definite ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria, were eligible for this study [20]. The other in- clusion criteria included an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Func- tional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) score between 31 and 46, riluzole treatment at the stable dose (50 mg, twice daily) at least 3 months prior to screening, and a disease duration no longer than 5 years prior to the first diagnosis. Patients who had participated in other clinical trials were excluded. The other exclusion criteria were a forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 40% of the predicted value, the presence of any con- comitant disease that might interfere with the outcome (neuro- logical disease other than ALS, psychiatric disorders, cancer, systemic disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal disor- der, or any other disease), tracheostomal ventilation or nonin- vasive ventilation (NIV) for more than 12 hours per day, a hemorrhagic tendency at the time of screening, and the admin- istration of any drug that could affect the BM. All patients pro- vided their written informed consent prior to the screening. Bone Marrow Extraction Each patient was admitted prior to the BME procedure. Under lo- cal anesthesia, BME was performed at the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or right lateral decubitus position. Approximately 50 ml of BM inocula was collected from each patient. On the day following BM extraction, the puncture site was examined, and the patient was then discharged if there were no adverse events (AEs). MSC Preparation and Culture The MSCs were isolated, expanded, and analyzed under good manufacturing practice conditions at Corestem, Inc. (Seoul, Re- public of Korea, http://corestem.com). BM mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Premium GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, http://www.gehealthcare. com) density gradient centrifugation. The mononuclear cells (2 3 105 cells) were placed in a 175-cm2 flask (Thermo Scientific Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark, http://www.nuncbrand.com) and cultured in CSBM-A06 medium (Corestem, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, http://www.lifetech.com), 2.5 mM L-alanyl-L -glutamine (Bio- chrom AG, Berlin, Germany, http://www.biochrom.de), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Biochrom AG) in a humidified incu- bator at 37°C under 5% CO2 conditions. The nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the medium. After removing the nonadherent cells, the culture medium was changed twice a week. When the MSC primary cultures reached 80% conflu- ence, the cells were harvested using 0.125% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and subcultured. Every harvest of MSCs resulted in a homogenous population of cells that displayed high expres- sion levels of CD29, CD44, CD73, and CD105 and low expression levels of CD34 and CD45 (Table 1). To confirm sterility, the sam- ples were cultured for bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mycoplasma, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was also performed to detect contaminating mycoplasma. No evidence of bacterial, fungal, viral, or mycoplasmal contamination was found (supplemental online Table 2). The MSCs were supplied as a sus- pension (concentration, 1 3 107 cells per ml) in autologous ce- rebrospinal fluid (CSF) and delivered to the hospital for administration to the patient in a container that was main- tained at 2–8°C for 30 minutes or less. Treatment Procedure The patients in the study received two successive intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs at 26-day intervals, at V5 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 592 Repeated Intrathecal Autologous BM-Derived MSCs Figure 1. Study design of the trial. This study consists of a 3-month lead-in period, a 4-month initial follow-up period, and an 8-month secondary follow-up period. The first MSC injection was performed at V5 (+0 months). The BM extraction at V3 (21 months) was for the first injection at V5. The BM extraction at V4 (2 days prior to V5) was for cells for the first injection at V6. Abbreviations: BME, bone marrow extraction MSC, mes- enchymal stromal cell Mo, months V, visit. Table 1.\n"

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis x Clinical trials x Mesenchymal stromal cells x Intrathecal ABSTRACT Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this open-label phase I clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in ALS patients. Eight patients with definite or probable ALS were enrolled. After a 3-month lead-in period, autologous MSCs were isolated two times from the BM at an interval of 26 days and were then expanded in vitro for 28 days and suspended in autologous cerebrospinal fluid. Of the 8 patients, 7 received 2 intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs (1 3 106 cells per kg) 26 days apart. Clinical or lab- oratory measurements were recorded to evaluate the safety 12 months after the first MSC injection. The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the Appel ALS score, and forced vital capacity were used to evaluate the patients’ disease status. One patient died before treatment and was withdrawn from the study. With the exception of that patient, no serious adverse events were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. Most of the adverse events were self-limited or subsided after supportive treatment within 4 days. Decline in the ALSFRS-R score was not accelerated during the 6-month follow-up period.

This phase III clinical trial (ALSUMMIT) protocol was developed to evaluate the long‑term efficacy and safety of the combined protocol of single‑cycle intrathecal therapy and three additional booster injections of BM‑MSC (Lenzumestrocel) treatment in patients with ALS. Methods: ALSUMMIT is a multicentre, randomized, double‑blind, parallel‑group, sham procedure‑controlled, phase III trial for ALS. The 115 subjects will be randomized (1:2:2) into three groups: (1) study Group 1 (single‑cycle, two repeated injections with 26‑day interval), (2) study Group 2 (single‑cycle + three additional booster injections at 4, 7, and 10 months), and (3) the control group. Participants who have an intermediate rate of disease progression will be included in this trial to reduce clinical heterogeneity. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by combined assess‑ ment of function and survival (CAFS), also known as joint rank scores (JRS), at 6 months (study Group 1 vs. control) and 12 months (study Group 2 vs. control) after the first Lenzumestrocel or placebo administration. Safety assessment will be performed throughout the study period. Additionally, after the 56‑week main study, a long‑term follow‑up observational study will be conducted to evaluate the long‑term efficacy and safety up to 36 months. Discussion: Lenzumestrocel is the orphan cell therapy product for ALS conditionally approved by the South Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). This ALSUMMIT protocol was developed for the adoption of enrichment enrolment, add‑on design, and consideration of ethical issues for the placebo group. †Jae‑Yong Nam and Tae Yong Lee contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: kskim@corestem.com kimsh1@hanyang.ac.kr 1 Central Research Center, Corestem Inc, Seoul, South Korea 7 Department of Neurology, Hanyang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author(s) 2022.

Protocol version {3} Funding {4} Author details {5a} Name and contact information for the trial sponsor {5b} Introduction Background and rationale {6a} Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of selective motor neu- rons in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord, which leads to progressive weakness with a fatal outcome due to paralyzed respiratory muscles within a mean of 2–4 years after diagnosis [1, 2]. Riluzole and edaravone are the only approved drugs by the Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA) with modest treatment effects on ALS progression [3, 4]. While the pathogenic mechanisms of sporadic ALS cases remain unknown, genetic mutations linked to the disease have provided a more accessible tar- get for therapeutic development [5]. The development of therapies that specifically target known ALS muta- tions, including chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), has been rapidly evolving in recent years [6–8]. Despite the emerging precision of medicine in the genetic cause of ALS, more than 90~95% of patients pre- sent with sporadic ALS, and their clinical manifestations are more heterogeneous [9]. Lessons from previous failed trials focused on a single molecular target have led us to develop a therapeutic strategy aimed at multiple targets related to non-cell-autonomous toxicity. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a prom- ising therapeutic strategy for addressing this issue. MSCs have been shown to exert diverse effects, such as stimulating intrinsic neurogenesis, releasing diverse Nam et al.

In a previ- ous phase II clinical trial, two repeated treatments with intrathecal autologous BM-MSCs interval) showed a therapeutic benefit lasting only 6 months, with good safety, in patients with ALS [14]. ALSUMMIT aims to evaluate the efficacy and long- term safety of two repeated (single-cycle) Lenzumestro- cel intrathecal treatments by extending the study period. Additionally, we will assess the safety and effi- cacy of single-cycle + three additional booster injec- tions. A post hoc survival analysis in our phase II trial did not show a long-term survival benefit. This may be associated with two limited injections with therapeu- tic effects that were not long-lasting. Considering the immunomodulatory effects of BM-MSC treatment by intrathecal delivery (less-invasive procedures), it would be essential to determine whether successive booster BM-MSC treatments after single-cycle treatment could improve long-term efficacy. Objectives {7} The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clini- cal superiority of Lenzumestrocel after its administra- tion compared to a placebo. The two primary endpoints will be evaluated by comparing the therapeutic efficacy between (1) study Group 1 (single-cycle, two repeated injections of Lenzumestrocel with 26-day interval) and the control group (two administrations of the placebo) at 6 months and (2) study Group 2 (single-cycle + three additional booster injections of Lenzumestrocel) and the control group (five administrations of the placebo) at 12 months in terms of joint rank scores (JRS), also known as the combined assessment of function and sur- vival (CAFS). The secondary endpoint will be evaluated by comparing the therapeutic efficacy between study Group 2 and the control group at 6 months in terms of JRS, change in ALSFRS-R score from baseline, and time to event at individually specified points after administra- tion. Additionally, as the exploratory endpoint, this study will investigate pulmonary function (slow vital capac- ity, SVC), muscular strength (hand-held dynamometry, HHD), time-to-event, and time-to-death. Finally, serially collected biological specimens during clinical trials will be used to develop biological markers to predict the effi- cacy and analyse the mode of action of Lenzumestrocel. Trial design {8} ALSUMMIT is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham procedure-controlled, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Len- zumestrocel in patients with ALS. This clinical trial con- sists of the main study (within a 17-week lead-in period and a 14-month treatment period) and an additional observational study (Fig. 1). Among participants, patients who wish to participate in further long-term observation studies will be followed up to 3 years after the first treat- ment. Randomization will be conducted by the stratified block randomization method considering the stratifica- tion factors Riluzole administration (Y or N) and ALS types (bulbar or limb) to ensure that subjects are ran- domly assigned to study Group 1, study Group 2, and the control group in a ratio of 1:2:2. The ALSUMMIT protocol was developed for the adop- tion of enrichment enrolment and add-on design and consideration of ethical issues for the placebo group. A total of 115 subjects who meet the criteria for eli- gibility and the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be ran- domly assigned using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to study Group 1, study Group 2, or the control group. Details of the eligibility and the inclusion/ exclusion criteria are described in the eligibility criteria section. All subjects will be observed for 14 months after the first administration of Lenzumestrocel or placebo. Methods: participants, interventions, and outcomes Study setting {9} The ALSUMMIT trial will be conducted in South Korea at five academic hospitals (Hanyang University Hospi- tal, Korea University Anam Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul National University Hospital, and Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital). All data will be collected at each site. Eligibility criteria {10} Participants who meet the following criteria will be included in this clinical trial: 1) Participants aged 25 to 75 years.\n",

Methods: In a phase 2 randomized controlled trial (NCT01363401), 64 participants with ALS were randomly assigned treatments (1:1) of riluzole alone (control group, n = 31) or combined with 2 BM-MSC injections (MSC group, n = 33). Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events. The primary efﬁcacy outcome was changes in Amyo- trophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) score from baseline to 4 and 6 months postinjec- tion. Post hoc analysis includes investigation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid biomarkers and long-term survival analysis. Results: Safety rating showed no groupwise difference with absence of serious treatment-related adverse events. Mean changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to 4 and 6 months postinjection were reduced in the MSC group compared with the control group (4 months: 2.98, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.48–4.47, p < 0.001 6 months: 3.38, 95% CI = 1.23–5.54, p = 0.003). The MSC group showed decreased proinﬂammatory and increased anti-inﬂammatory cytokines. In good responders, transforming growth factor β1 signiﬁcantly showed inverse correlation with monocyte chemoat- tractant protein-1. There was no signiﬁcant difference in long-term survival between groups. Interpretation: Repeated intrathecal injections of BM-MSCs demonstrated a possible clinical beneﬁt lasting at least 6 months, with safety, in ALS patients. A plausible action mechanism is that BM-MSCs mediate switching from pro- to anti-inﬂammatory conditions. A future randomized, double-blind, large-scale phase 3 clinical trial with additional BM- MSC treatments is required to evaluate long-term efﬁcacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2018 84:361–373 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within 2 to 4 years.1 The pathophysiological mechanisms of cell death (mostly of motor neurons) in ALS remain unclear, but recent studies using models of SOD1 mutant and ALS- associated genes including C9orf72, FUS, TDP43, UBQLN2, and TBK1 revealed that diverse molecular mechanisms such as altered protein degradation, RNA dysregulation, oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered immunoinﬂammation, and abnormal axonal transport are responsible for motor neuronal cell death.2–4 The concept of a non–cell-autonomous mechanism resulting in motor neu- ronal cell death supports further study of immunoinﬂamma- tory modulation as a stratergy for clinical therapeutics. Previous ALS clinical trials based on single molecular targets suggest the importance of integration of multiple molecular targets in the overall therapeutic strategy. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a desired approach for addressing this issue. MSCs exert diverse actions, such as stimulating intrin- sic neurogenesis, releasing diverse neurotrophic factors, and modulating immunoinﬂammatory processes.5,6 View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

ANNALS of Neurology reported that The wide range of MSC effects could be incorpo- rated in an alternative treatment strategy for ALS. More- over, autologous MSCs have multiple advantages in clinical practice, especially in relation to ethical concerns, lack of possible tumorigenesis, and graft rejections.7 MSCs regulate both innate and adaptive immune cells, through the release of soluble factors such as prostaglandin E2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thereby switching the patient’s environ- ment from a proinﬂammatory and toxic one to an anti- inﬂammatory and neuroprotective condition.8,9 Recently, we immunoregulatory mechanisms of MSCs, such as elevation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper-2 cells, play important roles in the mediation of neuroprotective effects on motor neuronal cell death in ALS, in a manner similar to the secretion of neurotrophic factors that are crucial to the effectiveness of MSCs in ALS.8 In addition, MSCs can modulate the functional properties of microglia via TGF-β secretion, switching them from a to an inﬂammation-resolving phenotype. These effects of MSCs could be an important therapeutic strategy to inhibit toxic neuroinﬂammatory processes in the symptomatic stage of ALS.2,8,9 classically activated phenotype (BM)-MSCs bone marrow–derived In our previous phase 1 trial, we reported the safety and feasibility of 2 repeated intrathecal injections of autol- ogous over 12 months.10 Furthermore, we reported that factors such as TGF-β, angiogenin (ANG), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cytokines secreted by BM-MSCs, play crucial roles in the response of an ALS patient to intrathecal autologous BM-MSC injection.11 Based on the action mechanisms of MSCs and ﬁndings from an in vivo transgenic mouse study, we hypothesized that repeated intrathecal BM-MSC administration could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for ALS.12 Herein, we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ALS to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of 2 repeated intrathecal injections of BM-MSCs for up to 4 months. In addition to this protocol, we evaluated the safety and efﬁcacy for an additional 2 months (total of 6 months), in accordance with Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) recommendations. To further understand the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of BM-MSC therapy in ALS patients, post hoc analyses of cytokines in cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) that reﬂect the immunomodulatory effects were conducted. In addition, we evaluated the long-term safety and survival beneﬁt of 2 repeated autologous BM-MSC treatments for up to a maximum 75 months to determine optimal protocols in a planned phase 3 clinical trial. Patients and Methods Study Design This study was a parallel-group, randomized, and con- trolled phase 2 trial (Fig 1A and Supplementary Table 1) performed at Hanyang University Hospital (Seoul, Repub- lic of Korea), a tertiary referral center for ALS. The study was conducted in 2 phases: ﬁrst within a 3-month lead-in period, and the second within a 4-month initial follow-up period, with an additional 2-month follow-up, for a total follow-up of 6-months. score Participants and Study Approval Participants (age = 25–75 years) were diagnosed with clin- ically probable or deﬁnite ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria.13 Other inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) between 31 and 46, (2) stable riluzole treatment (50mg, twice daily) for at least 3 months before screening, and (3) disease duration no longer than 5 years after the onset of the ﬁrst symp- tom. Participants were excluded if they met any of the fol- lowing criteria: (1) participation in other clinical trials within the past 12 months, forced vital capacity (FVC) of <40% of the predicted value, (3) presence of any comorbidity that might interfere with the outcome, (4) tracheostomy or noninvasive ventilation, (5) any hem- orrhagic tendency, and (6) administration of any drug that could affect the bone marrow. Participants were enrolled between December 2011 and November 2012, and follow-up of patients was conducted until July 2013. (2) The clinical trial protocol was approved and moni- tored by the local institutional review board (HYUH IRB 2010-C-70) and the KMFDS (MFDS-2413). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01363401). The overall trial-related activities and documents were moni- tored by the clinical research organization (Dream Clinical Investigation Services, Seoul, Korea). An external trial monitor was enlisted to protect the rights and well-being of the participants, verify the accuracy of the trial data, and guarantee compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before screening. Randomization and Masking All eligible participants were randomized (1:1) into 2 groups using the interactive Web response system: (1) MSC group (receiving 2 injections of BM-MSCs at a 26-day interval, 1 × 106 cells/kg) and (2) control group. Patients from both groups received continuous riluzole treatment (100mg/day), and symptomatic treatments were also allowed in both groups.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis x Clinical trials x Mesenchymal stromal cells x Intrathecal ABSTRACT Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this open-label phase I clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in ALS patients. Eight patients with definite or probable ALS were enrolled. After a 3-month lead-in period, autologous MSCs were isolated two times from the BM at an interval of 26 days and were then expanded in vitro for 28 days and suspended in autologous cerebrospinal fluid. Of the 8 patients, 7 received 2 intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs (1 3 106 cells per kg) 26 days apart. Clinical or lab- oratory measurements were recorded to evaluate the safety 12 months after the first MSC injection. The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the Appel ALS score, and forced vital capacity were used to evaluate the patients’ disease status. One patient died before treatment and was withdrawn from the study. With the exception of that patient, no serious adverse events were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. Most of the adverse events were self-limited or subsided after supportive treatment within 4 days. Decline in the ALSFRS-R score was not accelerated during the 6-month follow-up period. Two repeated intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs were safe and feasible throughout the duration of the 12-month follow-up period. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 SIGNIFICANCE Stem cell therapy is an emerging alternative therapeutic or disease-modifying strategy for amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To the authors’ best knowledge, there are no clinical trials to evaluate the safety of repeated intrathecal injections of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in ALS. After the clinical trial (phase I/II) was conducted, the stem cell (HYNR-CS, NEURONATA-R) was included in the revision of the regulations on orphan drug designation (number 160 December 31, 2013) and approved as a New Drug Application (Department of Cell and Gene Therapy 233 July 30, 2014) by the Korean Food and Drug Administration. The phase II trial is expected to be reported later. INTRODUCTION Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurode- generative disorder involving the motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. The disease is characterized by weakness, which culminates in death within 3–5 years [1, 2]. There is no effective therapeutic regimen for ALS. Recent clinical trials using var- ious type of stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [3], neural stem cells [4], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [5, 6], represent promising strategies for stem cell- based treatment in ALS. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the positive effects of MSCs, including their potent anti-inflammatory capacity, direct release of antiapoptotic and neurotrophic factors, and ability to induce the proliferation of local neural progenitor cells [7, 8]. Additionally, it has been reported that MSCs have the potential benefit of modulating the functions of immune cells involved in both adap- tive and innate immunity [9–12]. Altogether, this wide range of effects of MSCs might be beneficial for the treatment of ALS. In our previous study using superoxide dis- mutase 1 (SOD1) mutant mice, we evaluated the dose-dependent effects of human bone mar- row (BM)-derived MSCs. Administration of MSCs (1 3 106 cells) into the cisterna magna signifi- cantly prolonged the life span and slowed the disease progression [13]. These results suggest STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2015 4:590–597 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 Oh, Moon, Kim et al. 591 that intrathecal injection of an optimized number of MSCs might demonstrate a therapeutic potential for ALS. Recently, animal studies have shown that repeated intrathecal administrations of MSC were better than single administration [14, 15]. Previous clinical trials in ALS have showed that single intrathe- cal administration of MSCs is safe and feasible [16, 17]. The pilot clinical study (Hanyang University Hospital [HYUH] Institutional Review Board [IRB] 2005-452 and 2006-339) was performed we investigated whether two intrathecal injections of an opti- mized number of MSCs into ALS patients would be safe and fea- sible during a 6-month follow-up period. The results of the pilot study suggested that repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs might be useful for altering the disease progression in ALS patients [18, 19]. In the present study, we performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of two repeated intrathecal injec- tions of autologous BM-derived MSCs in patients with ALS during a 12-month follow-up period. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Overview This study was an open-label, single-arm, phase I trial to evaluate the safety of two repeated intrathecal injections of MSCs, con- ducted in Hanyang University Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The study was approved by the IRB of Hanyang University Hospital (HYUH IRB 2010-C-70) and by the Korean Food and Drug Admin- istration (KFDA-2413). This study was registered at http://www. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01363401). This study was divided into a 3-month lead-in period, a 4-month initial follow-up period and an 8-month secondary follow-up period (Fig. 1 supplemental online Table 1). During the 3-month lead-in period (visits 1–5 [V1–V5], 23 to 0 months), the patients visited the clinic every month to evaluate the natural progression of the disease. After the first MSC injection (V5, 0 months), all patients were assessed at monthly intervals during the 4-month initial follow-up period (V5–V9, 0 to +4 months). Af- ter that period, we extended the study (HYUH IRB 2013-06-019 and 2013-08-022) to further evaluate the safety for up to 12 months after the first MSC injection. The essential procedures of this clinical trial were composed of two bone marrow extractions (BME) and two intrathecal injec- tions. To allow sufficient time for MSC expansion ex vivo, each BME was performed 28 days prior to each MSC injection. The BM was extracted at V3 and V4. The MSCs were injected 28 days after each BME, at V5 and V6. The overall trial-related activities and documents were mon- itored by an independent auditing board (Dream Clinical Investi- gation Services, Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea, http://www. dreamcis.com). An external trial monitor was enlisted to protect the rights and wellbeing of the participants, to verify the accuracy of the trial data, and to guarantee that the conduct of the trial was in compliance with the approved protocol according to good clin- ical practice guidelines. Selection Criteria Patients between 25 and 75 years of age who were diagnosed with clinically probable or definite ALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria, were eligible for this study [20]. The other in- clusion criteria included an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Func- tional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) score between 31 and 46, riluzole treatment at the stable dose (50 mg, twice daily) at least 3 months prior to screening, and a disease duration no longer than 5 years prior to the first diagnosis. Patients who had participated in other clinical trials were excluded. The other exclusion criteria were a forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 40% of the predicted value, the presence of any con- comitant disease that might interfere with the outcome (neuro- logical disease other than ALS, psychiatric disorders, cancer, systemic disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal disor- der, or any other disease), tracheostomal ventilation or nonin- vasive ventilation (NIV) for more than 12 hours per day, a hemorrhagic tendency at the time of screening, and the admin- istration of any drug that could affect the BM. All patients pro- vided their written informed consent prior to the screening. Bone Marrow Extraction Each patient was admitted prior to the BME procedure. Under lo- cal anesthesia, BME was performed at the posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or right lateral decubitus position. Approximately 50 ml of BM inocula was collected from each patient. On the day following BM extraction, the puncture site was examined, and the patient was then discharged if there were no adverse events (AEs). MSC Preparation and Culture The MSCs were isolated, expanded, and analyzed under good manufacturing practice conditions at Corestem, Inc. (Seoul, Re- public of Korea, http://corestem.com). BM mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Premium GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, http://www.gehealthcare. com) density gradient centrifugation. The mononuclear cells (2 3 105 cells) were placed in a 175-cm2 flask (Thermo Scientific Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark, http://www.nuncbrand.com) and cultured in CSBM-A06 medium (Corestem, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, http://www.lifetech.com), 2.5 mM L-alanyl-L -glutamine (Bio- chrom AG, Berlin, Germany, http://www.biochrom.de), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Biochrom AG) in a humidified incu- bator at 37°C under 5% CO2 conditions. The nonadherent cells were removed by replacing the medium. After removing the nonadherent cells, the culture medium was changed twice a week. When the MSC primary cultures reached 80% conflu- ence, the cells were harvested using 0.125% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and subcultured. Every harvest of MSCs resulted in a homogenous population of cells that displayed high expres- sion levels of CD29, CD44, CD73, and CD105 and low expression levels of CD34 and CD45 (Table 1). To confirm sterility, the sam- ples were cultured for bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mycoplasma, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was also performed to detect contaminating mycoplasma. No evidence of bacterial, fungal, viral, or mycoplasmal contamination was found (supplemental online Table 2). The MSCs were supplied as a sus- pension (concentration, 1 3 107 cells per ml) in autologous ce- rebrospinal fluid (CSF) and delivered to the hospital for administration to the patient in a container that was main- tained at 2–8°C for 30 minutes or less. Treatment Procedure The patients in the study received two successive intrathecal injections of autologous MSCs at 26-day intervals, at V5 www.StemCellsTM.com ©AlphaMed Press 2015 592 Repeated Intrathecal Autologous BM-Derived MSCs Figure 1.

This phase III clinical trial (ALSUMMIT) protocol was developed to evaluate the long‑term efficacy and safety of the combined protocol of single‑cycle intrathecal therapy and three additional booster injections of BM‑MSC (Lenzumestrocel) treatment in patients with ALS. Methods: ALSUMMIT is a multicentre, randomized, double‑blind, parallel‑group, sham procedure‑controlled, phase III trial for ALS. The 115 subjects will be randomized (1:2:2) into three groups: (1) study Group 1 (single‑cycle, two repeated injections with 26‑day interval), (2) study Group 2 (single‑cycle + three additional booster injections at 4, 7, and 10 months), and (3) the control group. Participants who have an intermediate rate of disease progression will be included in this trial to reduce clinical heterogeneity. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by combined assess‑ ment of function and survival (CAFS), also known as joint rank scores (JRS), at 6 months (study Group 1 vs. control) and 12 months (study Group 2 vs. control) after the first Lenzumestrocel or placebo administration. Safety assessment will be performed throughout the study period. Additionally, after the 56‑week main study, a long‑term follow‑up observational study will be conducted to evaluate the long‑term efficacy and safety up to 36 months. Discussion: Lenzumestrocel is the orphan cell therapy product for ALS conditionally approved by the South Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). This ALSUMMIT protocol was developed for the adoption of enrichment enrolment, add‑on design, and consideration of ethical issues for the placebo group. †Jae‑Yong Nam and Tae Yong Lee contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: kskim@corestem.com kimsh1@hanyang.ac.kr 1 Central Research Center, Corestem Inc, Seoul, South Korea 7 Department of Neurology, Hanyang University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author(s) 2022.

Protocol version {3} Funding {4} Author details {5a} Name and contact information for the trial sponsor {5b} Introduction Background and rationale {6a} Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of selective motor neu- rons in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord, which leads to progressive weakness with a fatal outcome due to paralyzed respiratory muscles within a mean of 2–4 years after diagnosis [1, 2]. Riluzole and edaravone are the only approved drugs by the Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA) with modest treatment effects on ALS progression [3, 4]. While the pathogenic mechanisms of sporadic ALS cases remain unknown, genetic mutations linked to the disease have provided a more accessible tar- get for therapeutic development [5]. The development of therapies that specifically target known ALS muta- tions, including chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), has been rapidly evolving in recent years [6–8]. Despite the emerging precision of medicine in the genetic cause of ALS, more than 90~95% of patients pre- sent with sporadic ALS, and their clinical manifestations are more heterogeneous [9]. Lessons from previous failed trials focused on a single molecular target have led us to develop a therapeutic strategy aimed at multiple targets related to non-cell-autonomous toxicity. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a prom- ising therapeutic strategy for addressing this issue. MSCs have been shown to exert diverse effects, such as stimulating intrinsic neurogenesis, releasing diverse Nam et al.

In a previ- ous phase II clinical trial, two repeated treatments with intrathecal autologous BM-MSCs interval) showed a therapeutic benefit lasting only 6 months, with good safety, in patients with ALS [14]. ALSUMMIT aims to evaluate the efficacy and long- term safety of two repeated (single-cycle) Lenzumestro- cel intrathecal treatments by extending the study period. Additionally, we will assess the safety and effi- cacy of single-cycle + three additional booster injec- tions. A post hoc survival analysis in our phase II trial did not show a long-term survival benefit. This may be associated with two limited injections with therapeu- tic effects that were not long-lasting. Considering the immunomodulatory effects of BM-MSC treatment by intrathecal delivery (less-invasive procedures), it would be essential to determine whether successive booster BM-MSC treatments after single-cycle treatment could improve long-term efficacy. Objectives {7} The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clini- cal superiority of Lenzumestrocel after its administra- tion compared to a placebo. The two primary endpoints will be evaluated by comparing the therapeutic efficacy between (1) study Group 1 (single-cycle, two repeated injections of Lenzumestrocel with 26-day interval) and the control group (two administrations of the placebo) at 6 months and (2) study Group 2 (single-cycle + three additional booster injections of Lenzumestrocel) and the control group (five administrations of the placebo) at 12 months in terms of joint rank scores (JRS), also known as the combined assessment of function and sur- vival (CAFS). The secondary endpoint will be evaluated by comparing the therapeutic efficacy between study Group 2 and the control group at 6 months in terms of JRS, change in ALSFRS-R score from baseline, and time to event at individually specified points after administra- tion. Additionally, as the exploratory endpoint, this study will investigate pulmonary function (slow vital capac- ity, SVC), muscular strength (hand-held dynamometry, HHD), time-to-event, and time-to-death. Finally, serially collected biological specimens during clinical trials will be used to develop biological markers to predict the effi- cacy and analyse the mode of action of Lenzumestrocel. Trial design {8} ALSUMMIT is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, sham procedure-controlled, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Len- zumestrocel in patients with ALS. This clinical trial con- sists of the main study (within a 17-week lead-in period and a 14-month treatment period) and an additional observational study (Fig. 1). Among participants, patients who wish to participate in further long-term observation studies will be followed up to 3 years after the first treat- ment. Randomization will be conducted by the stratified block randomization method considering the stratifica- tion factors Riluzole administration (Y or N) and ALS types (bulbar or limb) to ensure that subjects are ran- domly assigned to study Group 1, study Group 2, and the control group in a ratio of 1:2:2. The ALSUMMIT protocol was developed for the adop- tion of enrichment enrolment and add-on design and consideration of ethical issues for the placebo group. A total of 115 subjects who meet the criteria for eli- gibility and the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be ran- domly assigned using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to study Group 1, study Group 2, or the control group. Details of the eligibility and the inclusion/ exclusion criteria are described in the eligibility criteria section. All subjects will be observed for 14 months after the first administration of Lenzumestrocel or placebo. Methods: participants, interventions, and outcomes Study setting {9} The ALSUMMIT trial will be conducted in South Korea at five academic hospitals (Hanyang University Hospi- tal, Korea University Anam Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul National University Hospital, and Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital). All data will be collected at each site. Eligibility criteria {10} Participants who meet the following criteria will be included in this clinical trial: 1) Participants aged 25 to 75 years.\n",

Methods: In a phase 2 randomized controlled trial (NCT01363401), 64 participants with ALS were randomly assigned treatments (1:1) of riluzole alone (control group, n = 31) or combined with 2 BM-MSC injections (MSC group, n = 33). Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events. The primary efﬁcacy outcome was changes in Amyo- trophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) score from baseline to 4 and 6 months postinjec- tion. Post hoc analysis includes investigation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid biomarkers and long-term survival analysis. Results: Safety rating showed no groupwise difference with absence of serious treatment-related adverse events. Mean changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to 4 and 6 months postinjection were reduced in the MSC group compared with the control group (4 months: 2.98, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.48–4.47, p < 0.001 6 months: 3.38, 95% CI = 1.23–5.54, p = 0.003). The MSC group showed decreased proinﬂammatory and increased anti-inﬂammatory cytokines. In good responders, transforming growth factor β1 signiﬁcantly showed inverse correlation with monocyte chemoat- tractant protein-1. There was no signiﬁcant difference in long-term survival between groups. Interpretation: Repeated intrathecal injections of BM-MSCs demonstrated a possible clinical beneﬁt lasting at least 6 months, with safety, in ALS patients. A plausible action mechanism is that BM-MSCs mediate switching from pro- to anti-inﬂammatory conditions. A future randomized, double-blind, large-scale phase 3 clinical trial with additional BM- MSC treatments is required to evaluate long-term efﬁcacy and safety. ANN NEUROL 2018 84:361–373 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within 2 to 4 years.1 The pathophysiological mechanisms of cell death (mostly of motor neurons) in ALS remain unclear, but recent studies using models of SOD1 mutant and ALS- associated genes including C9orf72, FUS, TDP43, UBQLN2, and TBK1 revealed that diverse molecular mechanisms such as altered protein degradation, RNA dysregulation, oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered immunoinﬂammation, and abnormal axonal transport are responsible for motor neuronal cell death.2–4 The concept of a non–cell-autonomous mechanism resulting in motor neu- ronal cell death supports further study of immunoinﬂamma- tory modulation as a stratergy for clinical therapeutics. Previous ALS clinical trials based on single molecular targets suggest the importance of integration of multiple molecular targets in the overall therapeutic strategy. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a desired approach for addressing this issue. MSCs exert diverse actions, such as stimulating intrin- sic neurogenesis, releasing diverse neurotrophic factors, and modulating immunoinﬂammatory processes.5,6 View this article online at wileyonlinelibrary.com.

ANNALS of Neurology reported that The wide range of MSC effects could be incorpo- rated in an alternative treatment strategy for ALS. More- over, autologous MSCs have multiple advantages in clinical practice, especially in relation to ethical concerns, lack of possible tumorigenesis, and graft rejections.7 MSCs regulate both innate and adaptive immune cells, through the release of soluble factors such as prostaglandin E2, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, thereby switching the patient’s environ- ment from a proinﬂammatory and toxic one to an anti- inﬂammatory and neuroprotective condition.8,9 Recently, we immunoregulatory mechanisms of MSCs, such as elevation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper-2 cells, play important roles in the mediation of neuroprotective effects on motor neuronal cell death in ALS, in a manner similar to the secretion of neurotrophic factors that are crucial to the effectiveness of MSCs in ALS.8 In addition, MSCs can modulate the functional properties of microglia via TGF-β secretion, switching them from a to an inﬂammation-resolving phenotype. These effects of MSCs could be an important therapeutic strategy to inhibit toxic neuroinﬂammatory processes in the symptomatic stage of ALS.2,8,9 classically activated phenotype (BM)-MSCs bone marrow–derived In our previous phase 1 trial, we reported the safety and feasibility of 2 repeated intrathecal injections of autol- ogous over 12 months.10 Furthermore, we reported that factors such as TGF-β, angiogenin (ANG), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cytokines secreted by BM-MSCs, play crucial roles in the response of an ALS patient to intrathecal autologous BM-MSC injection.11 Based on the action mechanisms of MSCs and ﬁndings from an in vivo transgenic mouse study, we hypothesized that repeated intrathecal BM-MSC administration could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for ALS.12 Herein, we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ALS to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of 2 repeated intrathecal injections of BM-MSCs for up to 4 months. In addition to this protocol, we evaluated the safety and efﬁcacy for an additional 2 months (total of 6 months), in accordance with Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) recommendations. To further understand the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of BM-MSC therapy in ALS patients, post hoc analyses of cytokines in cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) that reﬂect the immunomodulatory effects were conducted. In addition, we evaluated the long-term safety and survival beneﬁt of 2 repeated autologous BM-MSC treatments for up to a maximum 75 months to determine optimal protocols in a planned phase 3 clinical trial. Patients and Methods Study Design This study was a parallel-group, randomized, and con- trolled phase 2 trial (Fig 1A and Supplementary Table 1) performed at Hanyang University Hospital (Seoul, Repub- lic of Korea), a tertiary referral center for ALS. The study was conducted in 2 phases: ﬁrst within a 3-month lead-in period, and the second within a 4-month initial follow-up period, with an additional 2-month follow-up, for a total follow-up of 6-months. score Participants and Study Approval Participants (age = 25–75 years) were diagnosed with clin- ically probable or deﬁnite ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria.13 Other inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) between 31 and 46, (2) stable riluzole treatment (50mg, twice daily) for at least 3 months before screening, and (3) disease duration no longer than 5 years after the onset of the ﬁrst symp- tom. Participants were excluded if they met any of the fol- lowing criteria: (1) participation in other clinical trials within the past 12 months, forced vital capacity (FVC) of <40% of the predicted value, (3) presence of any comorbidity that might interfere with the outcome, (4) tracheostomy or noninvasive ventilation, (5) any hem- orrhagic tendency, and (6) administration of any drug that could affect the bone marrow. Participants were enrolled between December 2011 and November 2012, and follow-up of patients was conducted until July 2013. (2) The clinical trial protocol was approved and moni- tored by the local institutional review board (HYUH IRB 2010-C-70) and the KMFDS (MFDS-2413). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01363401). The overall trial-related activities and documents were moni- tored by the clinical research organization (Dream Clinical Investigation Services, Seoul, Korea). An external trial monitor was enlisted to protect the rights and well-being of the participants, verify the accuracy of the trial data, and guarantee compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before screening. Randomization and Masking All eligible participants were randomized (1:1) into 2 groups using the interactive Web response system: (1) MSC group (receiving 2 injections of BM-MSCs at a 26-day interval, 1 × 106 cells/kg) and (2) control group. Patients from both groups received continuous riluzole treatment (100mg/day), and symptomatic treatments were also allowed in both groups. In the control group, the 362 Volume 84, No. 3 Oh et al: Autologous BM-MSCs in ALS FIGURE 1: Study design and trial proﬁle. (A) The study design. (B) Scheduling of screening, randomization, treatment, and follow-up of the participants. The full analysis set was deﬁned as all randomized participants with baseline data and at least 1 efﬁcacy value. *Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale–Revised score was assessed for the primary efﬁcacy outcome. CSF = cerebrospinal ﬂuid MSC = mesenchymal stem cell SAE = serious adverse event. sham procedures related with stem cell therapy including BM aspiration, CSF collection for BM-MSC suspension, and lumbar puncture were not performed due to ethical considerations. Assessment of ALSFRS-R score, Appel ALS Rating Scale (AALS), and FVC were performed by neurologists and evaluators who were blinded to treatment assignments. Procedures The procedures comprised 2 bone marrow extractions (BMEs), at Visit 3 (−1 month) and Visit 4 (2 days prior to Visit 5), and 2 intrathecal injections, at Visit 5 (0 months) and Visit 6 (+1 month see Fig 1A). To allow sufﬁcient time for ex vivo MSC expansion, each BME was performed 28 days prior to each BM-MSC injection.
